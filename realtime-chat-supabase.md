<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">How I Finally Made My Chat Truly Real-Time</h1>

<p>At first, my chat felt like sending messages by pigeon. You’d write something, hit send, and the other person would only see it after refreshing the page.</p>

<p>Not very 2025. Not very Instagram. Not very fun.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">What I Actually Wanted</h2>

<p>I wanted something fluid. Like Instagram DMs or WhatsApp — where the message just appears. No tricks. No refresh.</p>

<p>That real-time magic you don't even think about, because it just works.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Why It Wasn't Working</h2>

<p>I was already using <strong>Supabase Realtime</strong>. It's a powerful system that listens to changes in the database and pushes updates in real time.</p>

<p>But I had messed up the implementation:</p>

<p>I was using two subscriptions that clashed.</p>

<p>Every time a new message came in, I reloaded the entire conversation — which was heavy, slow, and sometimes buggy.</p>

<p>Worse: live messages sometimes appeared without a sender name or avatar. Just an empty bubble. Creepy.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">What I Changed (Time to Stop Hacking)</h2>

<p>I deleted the part of the code that re-fetched everything on each new message.</p>

<p>Now, when a new message arrives, I simply append it to the current list.</p>

<p>If it’s from the other user, it appears instantly in the thread — no reload needed.</p>

<p>I also made sure every message has the right sender name and photo. If not already available, I fetch them right away and display them instantly.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">The Result</h2>

<p>Messages show up live, like on any modern app.</p>

<p>No more refreshing. No more “Did they answer yet?” moments.</p>

<p>Just smooth, clean, modern UX.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Why It Matters</h2>

<p>Because nobody wants a fake chat experience in 2025.</p>

<p>Because <strong>user experience</strong> is the core of everything I build.</p>

<p>Because when people chat on my app, I want it to feel like a real conversation — not like sending messages in a bottle.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">In Short</h2>

<p>I stopped faking real-time. Now the chat truly is real-time.</p>

<p>It’s not magic — just clean logic and a proper use of Supabase Realtime.</p>
