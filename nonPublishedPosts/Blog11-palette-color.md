  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">A Better Way to Choose Your UI Colors — Fast, Trendy, and Visual</h1>

  &nbsp;

  Yeah… I’ve been dumb.  
  I used to ask ChatGPT to create my brand’s color palette. It felt easy, logical, fast. But when I shared it on Reddit, people were like “Wait what? You asked ChatGPT for that?” 😅

  &nbsp;

  That’s when I realized: AI is great, but not for picking your brand’s visual identity.  
  Because taste, trends and contrast are just too subjective for GPT to guess well.

  &nbsp;

  So I searched better tools.  
  And I found the ultimate combo:

  &nbsp;

 🎨 **[Coolors.co Trending Palettes](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending)**  A library of stylish, trendy palettes curated by designers.

  🔧 **[Figma Color Palette Tester](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1127256140157343858/color-palette-tester)**  

  &nbsp;

  This tool lets you drop your palette into UI blocks, buttons, text, cards, etc. You instantly see how it looks in real-life layouts.

  Here's a screenshot of it in action:

  &nbsp;

  I tested 4 full palettes in 10 minutes. And it changed everything.  
  You quickly see what *feels right* for your product. No theory needed.

  &nbsp;

  🧠 **Lesson learned:**  
  Don't lait AI guide your aesthetics.  
  Try stuff. Play. Trust your taste. And test everything visually.
