<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Fixing My Header UX with Airbnb as My Design Coach</h1>

<p>I wasn’t happy with my site’s header. Structurally it made sense — but visually and UX-wise, it didn’t click. I had three main categories (<strong>Artistes</strong>, <strong>Prestataires</strong>, <strong>Partenaires</strong>), a few info links, and social icons... but the whole thing felt a bit scattered and cramped.</p>

<p>Then I looked at how <strong>Airbnb</strong> structures their top navigation. Super minimal: just a few large, well-aligned items, intuitive labels, and the rest tucked smartly away. It gave me a clear idea: I didn’t need to change everything — just focus on what users actually click and clean up the rest.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">The Fixes I Made (Small but Strategic)</h2>

<p>- I <strong>resized the icons/emojis</strong> next to each main section — the old ones were too tiny and made the layout feel awkward</p>
<p>- I aligned icons and text properly to create real <strong>navigation “tabs”</strong>, inspired by Airbnb’s vertical rhythm</p>
<p>- I replaced the "Plus +" label with a sleeker <strong>⋯ Découvrir</strong> menu — it feels more modern and less cluttered</p>
<p>- I reworked the "Suivez-nous" area: now the icons have <strong>hover states, alt text, titles, and open in new tabs</strong></p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">What I Learned About UX (And Myself)</h2>

<p>- Clear labels and aligned elements help users <strong>understand immediately where to click</strong></p>
<p>- A few design tweaks can give your site a way more <strong>professional and breathable look</strong></p>
<p>- I didn’t need to overbuild (like making a separate “Suivez-nous” page). Just improving the icons’ UX was enough</p>

<p>This might sound basic, but it’s the kind of iteration that reminds me why <strong>time to market ≠ rushing blindly</strong>. Taking time to learn from good design patterns — and reapplying them quickly — is often the fastest way to deliver a better experience.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Thinking Ahead</h2>

<p>I might move even more links down to the footer. Why? Because a simpler, cleaner top nav can dramatically improve focus and <strong>reduce cognitive load</strong> — something business schools would call a win in terms of <strong>UX scalability</strong>.</p>

<p>In short: I didn’t redesign everything. But by fixing what mattered, I made the product feel more solid, more elegant, and more intentional.</p>

<p>This is how I iterate — by building, breaking, watching, and fixing. Bit by bit.</p>
