<p>I'm a tech enthusiast currently based between Paris and London, where I study and explore everything related to product, design, and systems. I've also lived in Montreal and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about windsurfing which is obviously super convenient when you live in Paris or London. Until I figure out how to sail the Seine, I'm compensating with padel. Let me know if you ever need a partner â€” I play on the right!</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Short introduction</h2>
<p>For over a year, I've been working at Lazo, a B2B tech startup. I contribute across product and operations, refining the platform as it scales. Alongside that, I'm running BoostAi Consulting â€” a solo project where I experiment with AI tools and automation to help freelancers and small teams move faster.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>I love exploring new ideas and sharing what I build.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">From events to product</h2>
<p>Before working in tech, I spent a good amount of time in the event industry. I worked as head of waiter or event coordinator â€” I ran weddings, corporate gigs, and more. It's not what I wanted to do forever, but I'm really glad I went through it. I learned a lot. Honestly, even today, when I go to a wedding, I still think about how the backstage is running. Can't unsee it.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>I split my time between London and Paris â€” London for school, Paris for work (and because there's always something happening there).</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">My job in a startup</h2>
<p>I've worked at <strong>Lazo</strong> for over a year now. It started small, and now I'm deeply involved in product and operations. I manage sprint cycles, define priorities, assign tasks to developers, and keep things moving across teams. It reminds me of event management sometimes: nothing goes exactly as planned, and that's where I perform best.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>My scope has grown as the team has. I've worked directly with the founders, collaborated with the growth team, and supported devs by structuring processes. I also helped roll out tools like Intercom, and trained customer success and marketing teams to adopt them.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Tools I work with</h2>
<p>I've designed interfaces in Figma (UX/UI), automated flows using Zapier and Notion databases, handled data with SQL, and recently started coding front-end features in JavaScript â€” mostly using AI as a sidekick. That journey also helped me understand GitHub and how to ship more confidently.<br>
You can find my code here: <a href="https://github.com/Raph13009">github.com/Raph13009</a></p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">BoostAi Consulting</h2>
<p>On the side, I've been developing a personal project called <a href="https://www.boostaiconsulting.com/"><strong>BoostAi Consulting</strong></a>.<br>
I won't say it is a business for now but more a lab. I build things that are useful for freelancers and small teams: automated scripts for competitive intelligence, agents that look for job opportunities, tools that save people time.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>I can't go full-time on it for now and that's fine. My goal isn't profit. It's learning, testing, and staying curious. And honestly, it's already taught me way more than I expected.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">How I work</h2>
<p>I wouldn't call myself a dev or a designer â€” but I know enough to speak both languages and connect dots. What I enjoy the most is designing systems, organizing chaos, and shaping how people and tools interact.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><figure class="image-block"><img src="/images/process-map.png" alt="How I think in systems" class="fullwidth"><figcaption class="caption">How I think in systems</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>I'm also very reactive to pressure. The more intense the deadline, the more I go into "flow mode".<br>
Daily coffee, occasional Red Bull, no headphones though (they just throw me off), I've pulled entire nights debugging Python scripts or redesigning interfaces just to get something out the door.<br>
I like that kind of intensity.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Outside of work</h2>
<p>Most evenings, I'm either working on personal projects or cooking. I like doing real meals: tajines, lasagna â€” food that takes time. On weekends, I ride my bike or slow down a bit.<br>
I also try to read when I can, mostly during breaks or holidays.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>And of course, I travel as much as I can. I have family in Asia, and going back there regularly feels essential.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">What's next?</h2>
<p>No long-term plan for now.<br>
Maybe I'll launch my own product. Maybe I'll move back to the South of France, where I'm from.<br>
What matters most is that I keep learning, keep building, and keep moving forward.</p></article> <!-- Mobile --> <article class="sm:hidden text-base text-[#3a3a3a] leading-relaxed prose prose-lg max-w-none" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Hey, I'm Raph ðŸ‘‹</h1>
