<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Validating a Cybersecurity SaaS Idea (Before Writing Any Code)</h1>

<p>This week, I kept digging into the idea of launching a tool in the cybersecurity space. It’s my second post on the topic, and things are starting to feel more real.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>I’ve had a few long calls, including one with the founder of a cybersecurity company who’s been in the game for over 30 years. Honestly, I felt a bit out of my depth. I’m not from the industry, and staying credible in these conversations is hard but necessary.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>Cybersecurity is a massive space. And what makes it so promising is also what makes it so hard: it’s technical, it’s regulated, and it’s full of acronyms. But one thing is clear compliance matters. RGPD, ISO 27001, internal audits… These are not “nice-to-have” anymore. They block deals, they trigger legal risk, and they cost a lot.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>Most companies today rely on external consultants. They get an audit, maybe a PDF report, and they move on. Six months later, it's outdated. There’s space for something smarter.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>I’m imagining a personalized, automated dashboard. Something that helps teams track how aligned they are with cybersecurity norms, and suggests what to fix. Not for engineers for people in charge of governance, risk, and compliance (GRC).</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">But I’m Not Building Anything Yet</h2>

<p>The engineer I’m talking to wants to build a quick MVP. And honestly, that’s tempting. But I want to be sure there’s a real need before I dive in. That’s my priority right now.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>I’ve already contacted about ten GRC consultants. Some replied. Some didn’t. But the biggest learning so far is this: I need to talk to real buyers not just experts. That means:</p>

<p>– CTOs</p>
<p>– Cyber agencies</p>
<p>– Startups with compliance pressure</p>

&nbsp;

<p>It’s not going to be easy. Cold outreach isn’t glamorous. But if I want this to be useful (and profitable), that’s who I need to learn from.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">What I’m Learning About Myself</h2>

<p>I’m clearly taking the role of business dev here. I’ll never be the one writing the product code — and that’s fine. I bring something else to the table: I know how to identify hot topics, connect with people fast, and explore messy spaces without freaking out.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>This project also reminds me of something important: it’s okay to walk away if the need isn’t there. Right now, I’m going all in — evenings, weekends, whatever it takes but only as long as it makes sense.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>Maybe I’ll find another partner. Maybe I’ll pivot. But at least I’ll have learned something real not just launched another tool no one asked for.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Right now my focus is simple:</p>

<p>– More calls</p>
<p>– Better understanding of the GRC workflow</p>
<p>– Testing a few pain points live, with real users</p>

&nbsp;

<p>I’ll keep sharing what I learn. Cybersecurity may be a tough domain but it’s also one of the most important ones to get right.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>If you work in GRC, compliance, or cyber I’d love to talk. DM me.</p>
