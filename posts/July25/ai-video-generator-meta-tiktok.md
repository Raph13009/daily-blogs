<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Testing AI Video Tools for TikTok and Meta Ads: My First Results</h1>

<p>I’ve started using AI video generators to speed up content production — especially for short vertical videos meant for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and Facebook Ads.</p>

<p>After testing <a href="https://www.revid.ai/tools/ai-tiktok-video-generator"><strong>Revid</strong></a> and <a href="https://ai.invideo.io/watch/t0DYkTwwZfF"><strong>InVideo</strong></a>, I wanted to share what worked, what didn’t, and what to keep in mind before using these tools seriously in a marketing workflow.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Revid.ai: fast, decent, but not magical</h2>

<p>Revid gives you a form where you fill in the audience, tone, and product — and it spits out a full TikTok-ready video with stock footage, background music, and voiceover.</p>

<p>The output is quick and surprisingly coherent for a first draft. But:</p>

<p>- It still feels generic, unless you tweak every word manually.</p>
<p>- The AI voiceovers sound robotic, especially for Gen Z audiences.</p>
<p>- There's little control over footage pacing or style.</p>

<p>Still, for quick drafts or idea validation, it’s honestly solid. I could imagine using it to test value propositions before investing in a full shoot.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">InVideo AI: more flexible, more powerful</h2>

<p>InVideo AI lets you describe your video as a prompt (like Midjourney but for motion), and then generates both the script and the edit with synced visuals and transitions.</p>

<p>I tried a 30-second format targeting students with career anxiety — the result was fast and pretty engaging visually. The transitions are smooth, the music fits, and the timing works for short attention spans.</p>

<p>But again:</p>

<p>- You need to tweak the script to sound more human.</p>
<p>- Sometimes the visuals are off (ex: a corporate boardroom for a teen-focused message).</p>
<p>- You can’t yet export fully editable files unless you upgrade.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">What I Learned (Business Perspective)</h2>

<p>- These tools are perfect for <strong>MVP content testing</strong>: low cost, fast iteration, and decent quality.</p>
<p>- You still need a clear <strong>positioning</strong> to make the videos work — the AI doesn’t replace strategy.</p>
<p>- The best value is probably in <strong>time to market</strong>: going from idea to test ad in less than 10 minutes is a huge win.</p>
<p>- The videos are okay for **paid ads** (especially retargeting), but not yet ideal for top-tier branding.</p>
<p>- Like with any automation, it’s about **ROI**: if you can validate an angle with 10 € of media spend, it’s worth it.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Next Step: Combine with Performance Feedback</h2>

<p>Now that I can generate 5 videos in a day, the next challenge is understanding what works. Which hook grabs attention? Which voiceover converts better?</p>

<p>That’s where performance metrics from Meta Ads or TikTok Ads Manager become essential. AI video tools help me test faster — but they don’t decide what’s good. People do.</p>
