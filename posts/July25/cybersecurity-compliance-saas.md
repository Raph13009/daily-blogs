<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">From Weekend Chat to SaaS Potential</h1>

<p>This weekend, something clicked.</p>

<p>I was chatting with an engineer I met on Reddit. We talked about a bunch of things, but one point really stood out. He works with companies that collaborate with the government — either in France or across Europe. And for them, cybersecurity compliance isn't just a checkbox. It's a blocker if it goes wrong.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like RGPD, ISO 27001, or internal audits are now non-negotiable. If they don’t meet the requirements, they risk losing clients or failing to close deals. It’s not just about best practices. It’s about survival.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right now, most companies deal with this using external consultants. They run audits, fill out forms, and hand over a static PDF. It works, but it's slow, expensive, and often outdated within a few months.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That got me thinking. What if there was a better way?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imagine a clean SaaS tool, powered by AI, that lets any team know exactly where they stand on key compliance frameworks. Something that tells you what’s missing and how to fix it. No need for technical jargon. Just a clear view, with practical suggestions you can act on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don’t want to build another platform for cybersecurity pros. I want to build something that helps operations managers, startup founders, or even HR leads feel confident they're not missing something important.</p>

<p>Still just an idea. But definitely something I want to explore further.</p>
