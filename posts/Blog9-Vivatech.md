  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">My Experience at VivaTech 2025</h1>

  <p>I went to VivaTech on Thursday, June 12 and again on Saturday, June 14. It was exciting, intense, and full of ideas. Here’s what stood out to me the most.</p>

  &nbsp;

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">GitHub CEO’s Take on AI</h2>

  <p>I watched a talk from Thomas Dohmke, the <strong>CEO of GitHub</strong>, and I really enjoyed it. He shared his thoughts on AI and its future. One thing he said really stuck with me: AI agents won’t replace humans — because they don’t have ideas like we do. That made a lot of sense. He also said it’s great that coding is becoming easier and more accessible to everyone. I was super happy to see him speak live.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Discovering Scaleway</h2>

  <p>I also discovered <strong>Scaleway</strong>, a European cloud hosting company. Basically, they help you store and run your data online, like AWS or Google Cloud. What’s cool is that they’re based in Europe, so they follow European rules and data privacy laws. I think they’re still growing, but I love the idea of a local alternative. If I need to host data in the future, I would 100% try them.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">A Disappointing Chat with AWS</h2>

  <p>I also stopped by the <strong>AWS (Amazon Web Services)</strong> booth. I wanted to learn more about how they use AI to study large datasets. But unfortunately, the answers I got were very generic. Nothing very interesting. Maybe the person I talked to was just tired, or didn’t feel like talking much that day.</p>

  &nbsp;

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">DocuSign: Still a Fascinating Company</h2>

  <p>One company I’ve always been curious about is <strong>DocuSign</strong>. Their product is expensive and yet, I don’t really see any direct competitors. I used to think it was because they had strong legal tech. But after talking with them, I learned that they actually have <strong>huge product teams working on document processing in general</strong>. That’s where the cost comes from — and it makes sense. Super smart company with a long-term vision.</p>

  &nbsp;

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>VivaTech was a blast. I left with new ideas, new tools to explore, and a strong feeling that the European tech scene is moving fast — and in a good direction.</p>

  &nbsp;

<p>Of course, I also saw some really fun and futuristic stuff — like <strong>spherical screens</strong>, <strong>ultra-optimized keyboards</strong>, and even <strong>silent musical instruments</strong> that only play through headphones. It felt like walking through a live tech museum. Here’s one of the cool moments I captured:</p>

  <p>See you next year!</p>
