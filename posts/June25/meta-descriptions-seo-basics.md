<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What I Learned About Meta Descriptions (And Why It Matters)</h1>

Today’s post isn’t about something I discovered.  
It’s about something I thought I already knew.

I always knew what meta titles and meta descriptions were. I knew they were part of the `<head>` of your page, and that they help search engines understand your content. But what I didn’t know—until today—is that if you leave them out, **Google will just make them up**.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Why That’s a Problem</h2>

If your site isn’t clear enough, Google will rewrite your meta title and description for you. Sometimes it works. But often, it doesn’t.

This matters because your title and description are **the first thing people see** in search results. If you don’t control them, you’re leaving your first impression up to chance.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Best Practices for Meta Titles & Descriptions</h2>

- Keep meta descriptions **under 155 characters**, or they might get cut off.  
- Make sure they’re **unique** for each page.  
- Include **keywords naturally**, because Google bolds them in search.  
- You can add the **current year** (like “2025”) to improve relevance—but remember to update it.  
- Even though Google rewrites about **63%** of them, a well-written description still helps your CTR.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Other Things Google Looks At</h2>

If your image has no alt tag, Google doesn’t know what it shows.

Same thing for page titles, headings, and internal links. Be clear. Be human. Be helpful.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Tools That Help (Even If You're Not a Pro)</h2>

You don’t need to be an SEO expert to do this.  
Here are some tools I tried:

- **Yoast SEO**: great for beginners using WordPress.  
- **Frase**, **Clearscope**, or **Surfer SEO**: analyze your content vs. top results.  
- **Google Search Console**: lets you track your real meta performance—impressions, clicks, and CTR.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">The Takeaway</h2>

Don’t let Google guess what your page is about.  
Write your own meta titles and descriptions. Add alt text. Use clear headlines.  

It’s a small effort that makes a huge difference.
