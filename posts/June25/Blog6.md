# Fonts Aren’t Free?!

I spent way too long trying to find the perfect font for this blog.

&nbsp;

I thought it would be easy — just scroll through a list, pick one I like, and drop it in the code. Done.

&nbsp;

But nope. Turns out: **some of the best fonts aren’t free.**  
You actually have to buy them.

&nbsp;

That blew my mind a bit. I always thought in the world of code, everything was free and open. But nope — typography is a different world. Some fonts are open-source, yes, but many aren’t. And the good ones? Often locked behind a price tag.


&nbsp;

Still searching for one I love (and can afford).
