ðŸš€ Just shipped a new site for a client â€” built fast, polished, and made to last.

A few weeks ago, I got a message: They needed a simple, beautiful website for their upcoming campaign.  
No old-school templates, no bloated CMS â€” just a solid, made-to-measure product.

&nbsp;

So I rolled up my sleeves.

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Real tech under the hood</h2>

The base stack? **Vite** + clean JavaScript.  
I didnâ€™t take shortcuts: I coded the structure, tuned the design, and made sure the site was fast, responsive, and ready to scale.

This isnâ€™t one of those drag-and-drop sites that falls apart on mobile.

&nbsp;

The key difference? I still made it easy to manage.

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Zero-code for the client</h2>

Once the custom build was done, I connected everything to **Lovable**, a no-code editor Iâ€™ve been testing.

Turns out: you can share an entire project with Lovable, and let someone edit content, swap images, or even duplicate pages â€” **without ever seeing a line of code**.

Thatâ€™s exactly what I did. The result: A 100% custom site that now lives in a friendly no-code dashboard.

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Itâ€™s live â€” and it works</h2>

Hereâ€™s the current version (on a temp domain for now): [**Link to the website**](https://bluegarden.site)

And honestly? Itâ€™s one of the cleanest builds Iâ€™ve done in that time frame.  
In less than 3 weeks, we went from idea â†’ production â†’ handoff.

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Why Iâ€™ll keep doing it this way</h2>

- I got to work with a real stack (not some restrictive CMS)  
- The client keeps full control, even with no technical skills  
- The handoff is smooth â€” like passing a Notion doc, but itâ€™s a full site

&nbsp;

This blend of **real code + real autonomy** is exactly what I want to offer more often.

Small scope, high standards â€” and a setup that grows with the client.
