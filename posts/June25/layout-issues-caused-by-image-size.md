# Turns Out the Problem Was the Images

I spent hours trying to fix the layout on my blog.

&nbsp;

I wanted the text and images to feel centered and clean. First, I thought it was a padding issue. Then maybe the plugin was bugging. Or maybe something was off in the `slug`. I kept trying to tweak the spacing around the text, moving things by a few pixels, testing, undoing, redoing… but nothing worked.

&nbsp;

And then, I took a break. I breathed. I stepped back.  
That’s when it clicked.

&nbsp;

**The problem wasn’t the text. It was the images.**  
Some of them were just *too wide by default*. No matter what I did with padding or layout, the oversized images were overpowering the rest — pushing things out of balance.

&nbsp;

Once I resized them — gave them a more reasonable `max-width`, the layout started to feel right!  

&nbsp;

So yes: image sizing matters *a lot more* than I expected. Maybe even more than text spacing sometimes.  

&nbsp;

A good reminder that when the layout feels wrong, the issue might not be where you think it is.
