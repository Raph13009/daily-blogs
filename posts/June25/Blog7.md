# From ChatGPT to Adobe Color: A Quick Tip for Designers

&nbsp;

For a long time, I used ChatGPT to generate color palettes.  
It actually worked really well — just ask it for 3 palettes that match a vibe or theme, and you’ll get something solid.

&nbsp;

I still recommend it for quick ideas. But recently I found something better: <a href="https://color.adobe.com" class="underline">Adobe Color</a>.  
It’s a free tool, super visual, and kind of addictive if you like messing with colors.

&nbsp;

The way it works is simple: you pick a color, and it shows you all the matching tones along the same line of the color wheel.  
You can also play around — drag the handles, try different harmony rules, or even extract palettes from an image.

Here’s what I like about it:
- You can build palettes using real color theory
- You get complementary, analogous, triadic palettes, etc.
- You can randomize combos and explore
- It’s just fun to use and feels creative

&nbsp;

So now I use both:  
ChatGPT when I want fast inspiration with text prompts,  
and Adobe Color when I want to fine-tune something more visual or aligned with real design logic.

If you haven’t tried it, I really recommend giving it a go.
