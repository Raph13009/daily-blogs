&nbsp;

I started with Lovable. Honestly, it’s impressive — you answer a few questions, and boom, you get a full site.  
But after two days, I hit a wall. I couldn’t control everything. I couldn’t make it feel like *me*.

&nbsp;

So I did something I thought I wouldn’t: I rebuilt my site from scratch.  
No dev background, no experience in front-end frameworks — just curiosity and a lot of Google searches.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Why I ditched Lovable</h2>

&nbsp;

I didn’t want a complex product. I just wanted a site that felt clean, intentional, and easy to update.  
But to get there, I needed to understand what was going on under the hood — at least a little.

&nbsp;

So I picked Astro. Reopened a Cursor subscription. Synced a GitHub repo.  
It wasn’t magic — but it made sense.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">I broke it down by day</h2>

&nbsp;

I knew I wasn’t shipping the site in one evening.  
So I built a rhythm that worked for me:

&nbsp;

<p>– Monday: I had a clear idea of what I wanted</p>
<p>– Thursday: The site was fully working with all the features I needed</p>
<p>– Friday: the design and styles were exactly how I imagined them</p>
<p>– Saturday: I had a few blog posts and a solid About page, ready to go</p>
<p>– Sunday: I built a process to publish posts easily, without spending an hour every time</p>
<p>– Sunday night: the site was online.</p>


&nbsp;

That night, the site went live.

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">The best part? I actually want to keep using it</h2>

&nbsp;

The biggest win isn’t just that it works — it’s that I want to come back to it.  
Since launching, I’ve already changed the homepage copy twice.  
It’s easy. It’s fast. And it feels like my space.

&nbsp;

There are still things I want to improve. But the fact that I understand how the site works — even without being a developer — changes everything.

&nbsp;

If you’ve been putting off rebuilding your site because you’re “not technical,” I get it. But honestly? Learning just enough to build your own setup is super worth it.
