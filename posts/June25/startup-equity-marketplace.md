<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Why I Joined a Music Startup as CPO</h1>

&nbsp;

This week, I joined a new project.  
For days, I looked at posts in business school groups and incubators.  
I saw many teams with strong ideas — but no tech people.

&nbsp;

Some already talked to web agencies. The price?  
Between **10K and 30K euros** to build a platform.  
That includes UX, frontend, backend, database… everything.

&nbsp;

I already knew these agencies are in high demand. But I also saw how **hard it is for non-dev teams** to move fast or make smart product decisions.  
That’s why having a technical person on the team even just one makes a big difference.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">How I Picked the Right Project</h2>

I spoke with 3 different teams.  
One of them really clicked: a **music project**, building something for artists.  
They had a clear vision, but no tech support.

&nbsp;

I decided to join as their **CPO** (Chief Product Officer).  
My mission: build a real **marketplace platform**.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">No Money, Just Equity</h2>

We made a deal:  
I build the platform **for free**, and in return, I get **an equity percentage**.

&nbsp;

Some people on Reddit say “never work for equity” because 90% of early projects fail.  
They’re not wrong!
But in my case, it’s different: I’m not just doing the dev.  
I’m part of the team. I help shape the strategy. I grow with the startup.

&nbsp;

And I’m learning a lot by the way.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Where I’m At Now</h2>

I had already built a few marketplaces for fun before so I used that experience to go faster.

&nbsp;

In just 15 hours, I got a very clean version.  
It’s still early, but I’m super proud of the result. And it’s only the beginning.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Why This Is a Win for Me</h2>

<P>- I bring real product skills to a motivated team</p> 
<P>- I learn by building something real, not just ideas</p>
<P>- I feel part of something, not just coding on the side</p>

&nbsp;

There’s still a lot to do. But I’m excited for what’s next.
