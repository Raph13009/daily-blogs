# I am starting the blog today. I will post pieces of my work many times a week.

I really love the idea that Austin Kleon explained in his book, <a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work" class="underline">Show Your Work</a>. I decided to start now.

&nbsp;

 The goal is to explain my creative process and the struggles I face, so it will be interesting to reread this blog in the future\ I'm not finished with the book yet, but I'm so excited about this new project that I'm launching it at the same time. People my age share a lot of their lives on social media like Instagram and TikTok. I'm present on some of these platforms, but I'm not that comfortable with them.

&nbsp;

That's why having my own space here is so great for me. This is my personal space where I can be myself.

I haven't finished the book yet, but I'm so excited about this new project that I'm launching it at the same time. People my age share a lot of their lives on social media like Instagram and TikTok. I'm only on Instagram, but I'm not that comfortable with the platform. That's why having my own space here is so great for me. This is my personal space where I can be myself.
