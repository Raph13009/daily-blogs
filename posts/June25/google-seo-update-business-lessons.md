<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What I Learned from Google's 2025 SEO Update</h1>

This week I took time to understand the latest SEO rules from Google.  
It wasn’t just about websites, it actually reminded me of some key business school topics: **UX, time to market, iteration cycles, ROI, scalability**... all hidden behind what looks like a "tech update".

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Google Now Ranks UX First</h2>

Google is prioritizing **user experience** more than ever.  
If your site is slow, unstable or frustrating to navigate, you drop. That’s it.  
It’s all measured with Core Web Vitals: LCP (loading speed), INP (interactivity), CLS (layout stability).  

As a business student, I saw the parallel instantly: **UX is not a nice-to-have**.  
It’s a competitive advantage and a lever to increase **conversion rates, retention**, and trust.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Content Has to Be Useful or It Vanishes</h2>

The March 2025 update clearly penalizes low-value, generic, AI-only content.  
Google wants answers. Not word count.  

It reminded me of the time to market idea: publishing fast is good, but publishing something that actually solves a user’s pain is better.  
That’s also why iteration loops matter. It’s not about the first version, it’s about improving based on what your audience searches.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">AI Content ≠ Bad Content (If You Do It Right)</h2>

Google doesn’t ban AI but they **reward clarity, structure, expertise**.  
I realized that using GPT is fine… **as long as you bring human insight** and make it credible (author info, sources, personal take).

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">No More Keyword Stuffing. Context Wins.</h2>

Old SEO was about repeating the same keyword again and again.  
Now it’s about matching the **user’s real intent** with natural language.

From a strategic view, that’s a reminder that **scalability only works if your content meets real needs**.  
You can’t scale empty noise. But you can scale relevance.

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">What I'm Doing Differently</h2>

<p>- Running PageSpeed tests and fixing bad scores</p>  
<p>- Rewriting shallow articles with better structure and examples</p> 
<p>- Adding sources or author blurbs to show reliability</p>   
<p>- Targeting long-tail questions instead of single keywords</p>   
<p>- Thinking about each article like a product MVP: does it solve something?</p> 

&nbsp;

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">In Short</h2>

Google’s new rules are basically a **business strategy lesson** in disguise:  
If your website is fast, useful, trustworthy and scalable, you grow.  
If not, you sink.
